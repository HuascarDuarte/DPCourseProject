#Stock Prices Application

  The stockPrices app looks up stock prices by ticker symbol and displays the results as a line chart. The app lets you:

1. Select a stock to examine,
2. Pick a range of dates to review,
3. Choose whether to plot stock prices or the log of the stock prices on the y axis,
4. Decide whether or not to correct prices for inflation, and
5. Choose which type of graph to display (line, candlestick, matchstick or bars).
  
By default, it is displayed the **SPY** ticker (an index of the entire S & P 500). 

To look up a different stock, type in a stock symbol that Yahoo finance will recognize. 

You can find a list of Yahooâ€™s stock symbols here [http://finance.yahoo.com/lookup]. 

Some common symbols are GOOG (Google), AAPL (Apple), and GS (Goldman Sachs).
